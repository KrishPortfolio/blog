## Introduction

Welcome to the launch of the new blog website and my first blog post! My name is Krish Shah and I am so excited to share with you MORE of what my projects and personal life! The amount of ideas, how-to’s and inspiration whirling around in my head is ready to jump out. I wanted to start by telling you why I created this blog, what you will be seeing more of in my posts.

## Why I started my blog

Since I started freelancing, many of my clients have asked me “Why don’t you start a blog?!” and up until a few months ago did not truly know what a “blog” was. I never clicked on blog links, I never understood WHY people wrote blogs, I just thought it was a waste of time to even look into it. WRONG I WAS. After doing much research and making friends with a few bloggers along the way, who have been so kind to offer much support and advice, I have become completely consumed with inspiration to start a blog for Horderly. I have finally realized all of the benefits that blogging can bring.

## What you will be seeing more of in my posts

Programming will obviously be the main topic of my blog, but also see different topics like my opinions on newly released technology and my process through college admissions. Writing has never been a strong suite of mine and I will tell you, I am no expert on any of this. I may be a “perfectionist” but I am nowhere near perfect. I figure it will be a lot of trial and error so please bear with me on any grammar/spelling mistakes (disclaimer – I like to talk with many dashes and parentheses) and please feel free to always share your advice and communicate with me along the way! I hope to inspire you because truthfully, you all inspire me and I am SO looking forward to bringing you a more organized way of living.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello World!";
  return 0;
}
// prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.

```python
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

p1 = Person("John", 36)

print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)
