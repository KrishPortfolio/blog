## Introduction
Hello Everyone, I am happy to say that today was my final day of Freshman Year and I ready to spend my first summer as a High Schooler. I plan to spend my time wisely by involving myself in more out of school extracurriculars, continue pursuing my hobbies, and also have a small taste of college.

### Out of School Extracurriculars
For out of school extracurriculars I would like to continue some activities that I did during the school year but maybe gain more leadership and have more responsibility. First, I am continuing Boy Scouts as I want to continue ranking up by gaining more hands on skills, camp more, cook more, and lead my peers. A couple weeks ago we have leadership elections and I was voted to be Webmaster which means I get to update the Troop website. This will be some great additional web development experience which can help other kids be interested in scouting and also make planning events easier for adults. 

I am also planning to recontinue my 2nd Degree Black Belt in Taekwondo. I actually used to Taekwondo a lot (3-4 days per week) when I was in 5th grade but as I took more challenging courses and got into school clubs, I lost time to participate in Karate. That is why I plan to slowly recontinue in order to respark my interest and also have another form of exercise. 

Finally, I have been doing Lego Robotics for a long time (first as a participant in elementary  school and now a mentor for the middle school) and plan to use my advanced knowledge in teaching young children in my community. My plan is to make flyers about my class which would have my email, number, prices, and sign-up form (QR code). I plan to send out the flyers through messaging groups (WhatsApp and NextDoor) and hang flyers in the Municipal Building. I already have a small interest group of local kids but plan to see if more are interested. This is a type of passion project I have as I have a passion for teaching and robotics. This will also help me earn some "pocket money" for me that I can use through the summer and help kickstart my college savings. I also plan to donate a partial amount of profit to local organizations. My teaching plan is simple as I already have presentation prepared, an EV3 Mindstorms Kit, and an old field set up from 2017. 

### Hobbies
During the summer I plan to continue pursuing device creation and also try to do some freelance web development. I saw this website called Fiverr and might join that as I can do some paid web development without leaving the comfort of my desk. I also want to see if local businesses need help building websites to increase revenue stream and online orders. For device creation, I plan to use Raspberry Pi(s) and Arduino(s) to create devices that I can use around the house and maybe improve on my exsiting device, the iNappy (a device that beeps, flashes, and texts phone when baby soils diaper).

### Summer Programs
In addition to relaxing, involving myself deeply in my out of school extracurriculars, and pursuing my hobbies, I am also going to have a small taste of college through Summer Programs. In March, I applied to both the Brown STEM Summer Program and MIT LLCipher program and was accepted into both. This would means I would go to Brown University and MIT during the summer. 

I plan to go to Brown from June 24 to July 5 where I will stay on campus with other students from all around the world. I will be attending a program called Biomedical Engineering and Device Design which is taught by Brown University Graduate Students where I will learn all about the merging of the human body and engineering. I have actually done some projects related to Biomedical Engineering in the past and plan to show that to my instructor when I get there. My main goal is to obviously learn but also meet with other students around the world with similar interests as me. 

I also plan go to MIT from August 5 to August 9 where I will be attending the LLCipher program sponsored by MIT's Lincoln Laboratory. In this course I will learn about ancient cryptography and how it is still used in modern technology. At the end of the program, I will get an exclusive tour at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory. 

## Final Thoughts
Overall, I have a lot to do this summer and am excited to start this journey. Though many say that I am doing "too much", I feel that I am doing just the right amount to better myself and also jumpstart myself for the next steps of High School.
