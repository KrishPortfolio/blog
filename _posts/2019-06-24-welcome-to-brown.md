## Introduction
Hello Everyone, I am excited to announce that after a tiring 4 hour drive, I am at Brown for my STEM Summer Program. The process after stepping onto campus was hectic as I had to first check in, get my ID, find my dorm and unpack, and then go to orientation. As I live in NJ, I had to say bye to my family pretty early on as my parents were still working and had to leave after I was settled in. The campus is amazing but the only downside I see is the lack of air conditioning in the dorms, meaning I had to bring a box fan. This was an extra hassle in the moving process but its worth it to stay at an IVY League institution. I am going to attach a photo collage to this blog post.
